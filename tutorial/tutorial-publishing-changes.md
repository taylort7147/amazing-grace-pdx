# Publishing changes

In order for any changes to be published to the website, you must *commit* your file changes to this repository<sup>1</sup>. There are a couple of ways to do this, but the simplest way for someone without a programming background is through the [in-browser editor](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository). With this GitHub tool you can directly edit the files in your browser and commit them to the repo all in one place.

The other way involves using a Git client such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/en/desktop) to push your local changes to the GitHub repository. You can learn more about how to do so [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git), but this method has a steeper learning curve.

<sup>1</sup>A repository (or *repo*) is a version control system (VCS) that allows multiple users to work on a single project without having multiple copies of each file floating around. GitHub is a website that uses Git, a VCS, to host public and private repositories.
